*"Not all those who wander are lost; not all encryption that glitters is secure. The strength of the old ways runs deep, and in the tongues of the Eldar and Ancient tongues lies Power. Some traverse quantum linguistic dimensions, weaving and creating ancient vocabulary entries to forge cryptographic protection that makes enterprise systems look like amateur hour. You must have forgot, The Singularity Class has awakened."*
